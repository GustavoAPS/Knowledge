    <h5>HTML Basics</h5>

    <ul>
      <li>
        A project generally has a file called index.html, that is the ‘main’
        file for the project.
      </li>
      <li>
        HTML is for hypertext markup language, it is used to structure a web
        page.
      </li>
      <li>
        Elements of a HTML page are put with tags, that look like this
        &#60;name_name&#62;&#60;/tag_name&#62;, the reason we have two of the
        same tag, is because the first one is the ‘opening’ one and the second
        with the / character is the closing one.
      </li>
      <li>
        A HTML file will always have the tags &#60;html&#62;&#60;/html&#62; .
        Inside html tag we may have the language definition for the page, this
        help some browsers with screen readers for example to know the language
        of the page.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then we have two other sections, the head and the body. Head is where we
        put the settings of the page like for example the tittle with the tittle
        tag. The body section is where we put elements that will be visible in
        the page, like texts, images or buttons.
      </li>
      <li>In HTML elements may be nested one inside the other.</li>
      <li>
        Elements may have attributes inside them, attributes are placed in the
        opening tag of the element, and give additional information about the
        element, the image element may have attributes defining the size of the
        image like the &#60;a&#62;&#60;/a&#62; element may have the link for the
        attribute being set. This looks like this: &#60;a
        href="https://www.google.com"&#62;Google&#60;/a&#62;
      </li>
      <li>
        Classes and ID's are used in html to identify elements, so they can be
        selected in the CSS and Javascript
      </li>
      <li>
        Classes can be used over many elements, but ID's can be used only once
        in a page, here an example of each:<br />
        &#60;p class="paragraph-style"&#62;<br />
        &#60;p id="unique-style"&#62;<br />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>HTML Boilerplate</h5>
    <p>
      We do not need to write all the HTML structure every time we need to write
      HTML code, this is why we have the boilerplate code, it is a piece of code
      with a stadard structure of all the basic HTML we will need by standard.
    </p>
    <h5>HTML Intermediate/Advanced</h5>
    <p>
      Some characters in HTML are reserved for the language like symbol for
      greater than or less than, when needed to write these characters we need
      to use html entities.
